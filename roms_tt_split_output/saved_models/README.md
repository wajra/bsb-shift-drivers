# saved_models (Saved models)

This folder contains the saved models that were generated during model runs for Bandara et al. (2023)

At the end of each model run, the models themselves were saved in the .Rdata format.
Each file is named so that it details the covariates used in the model. For example `jb_CEmods_Nov2017_GMEXdrop_salinity_seasonal_mean_model_tt_split_2021_04_11_centropristis striata_Atl.RData` details that this model was to test effect of seasonal salinity on the shift in species biogeography .
