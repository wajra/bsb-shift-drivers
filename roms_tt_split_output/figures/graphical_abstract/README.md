_"Marine species are shifting to new locations at rapid rates, but the environmental factors driving these changes are not clear. We analyzed the shift of Black Sea Bass (Centropristis striata), a fast-moving fish in the Northeast US, over thirty years. We found that oxygen was an important factor explaining the shift through time, in addition to temperature and prey. Marine species are sensitive to oxygen, and we encourage researchers to use ocean biogeochemical hindcast and forecast products to better understand marine biogeographic changes."_
