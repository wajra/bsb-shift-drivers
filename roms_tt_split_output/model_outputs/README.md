# model_outputs (Model outputs)

This folder contains the model predictions that were generated during model runs for Bandara et al. (2023)

At the end of each model run, the model predictions (for presence/absence and biomass) were saved in .csv format.
Each file is named so that it details the covariates used in the model. For example `sbt_min_model_tt_split_2021_04_11_split_predictions.csv` details that these predictions are from the model was to test effect of minimum temperature on the shift in species biogeography .
