# model_diagnostics (Model Diagnostics)

This folder contains model diagnostics generated during model runs for Bandara et al. (2023)

At the end of each model run, diagnostics are saved using both .csv and .Rdata formats.
Each file is named so that it details the covariates used in the model. For example `jb_modeldiag_Nov2017_to_interaction_salinity_2021_12_02.Rdata` details that this model was to test the shift in species biogeography with factoring in the statistical interaction between temperature and dissolved oxygen along with salinity as a separate covariate.
