# CEmodelGAMsmooths

This folder contains GAM response curves generated during model runs for Bandara et al. (2023)

Each file is named so that it details the covariates used in the model. For example `JB_GAMs_Revised_Nov2017_GmexDrops_metabolic_index_without_sbt_and_o2_tt_split_2021_04_11.pdf` details that this model was to test the shift in species biogeography with just using metabolic index without factoring in temperature and dissolved oxygen.
