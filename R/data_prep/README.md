# data_prep (Data Preparation)

This README.md contains a general guide to the R scripts that were used to prepare some raw data for Bandara et al. (2023)

Please read this text to properly execute the code.

Languages: R (Version 4.1+)

A brief description of the files listed here and their purpose

1. `roms_transformation_part_01.R` - Some simple visualizations of the ROMS hindcast data and validating against survey recorded temperature data
2. `roms_transformation_part_02.R` - Plot histograms of the data
3. `roms_transformation_part_03.R` - Do some basic transformations of certain covariates (It should be noted that we didn't use transformed data in the analysis and models)
4. `roms_transformation_part_04.R` - Save the data with these transformations and save some visualizations of the transformations
