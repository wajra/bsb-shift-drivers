# decadal_means (Decadal means)

This folder contains two sub-folders with data files that are used to generate Figure 2 for Bandara et al. (2023)

Each folder corresponds to a decade. Decadal means for each covariate are stored as gridded text files (362 x 720 dimensions). These are read and visualized to produce Figure 2 using a script in the Python folder.
